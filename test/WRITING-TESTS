Main.hs is a small wrapper around HUnit that opens a database connection and
starts the HUnit text-based test controller.

To add a new module to the test suite, do the following:

 * Create a new module that exports a function of type Connection -> Test.
   'Test' is basically a tree of 'Assertion's, where 'Assertion' is just a type
   alias for IO ().  See Bytea.hs for reference.

 * Add an entry to 'tests' in Main.hs (along with the corresponding
   module import) so the test driver will know about the new module.

 * Add the module to postgresql-simple.cabal, under test-suite > other-modules.
   Otherwise, the module will be left out of the tarball generated by
   `cabal sdist`, and tests will fail to build when installing from Hackage.
