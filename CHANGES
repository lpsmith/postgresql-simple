Version 0.2: (2012-06-19)
  * Removed the conversion from `timestamp` to `UTCTime`.  Some code will be
    broken even though it will still compile.

  * Renamed a number of data constructors, mostly in the BuiltinTypes module.

  * Exported ToRow/FromRow from Database.PostgreSQL.Simple


Version 0.1.4.3: (2012-06-10)
  * Fix language extensions for compatibility with GHC 7.0

Version 0.1.4.2: (2012-06-10)
  * Fix a wayward dependency on Text.

Version 0.1.4.1: (2012-06-10)
  * Added support for timezones with minutes in their UTC offset.

Version 0.1.4: (2012-06-10)
  * Removed pcre-light dependency,  courtesy of Joey Adams.

  * Reworked support for the Time types.

      * The conversion from PostgreSQL's `timestamp` (without time zone) type
        to Haskell's `UTCTime` type is deprecated and will be removed in 0.2.

      * `Data.Time.LocalTime` now has `FromField`/`ToField` instances.  It is
        now the preferred way of dealing with `timestamp` (without time zone).

      * `Database.PostgreSQL.Simple.Time` is a new module that offers types
        that accomodate PostgreSQL's infinities.

      * All time-related `FromField`/`ToField` instances are now based on new,
        higher-speed parsers and printers instead of those provided by the
        time package included in GHC.

  * Planned breaking changes for 0.2:

      * Removing the conversion from `timestamp` to `UTCTime`.

      * Renaming some of the type names in `BuiltinTypes`.


Version 0.1.3: (2012-05-30)
  * Made ZonedTime an instance of FromField and ToField

  * Added getNotificationNonBlocking


Version 0.1.2: (2012-05-09)
  * Switched to libpq-based escaping for bytea types;  Binary now works with
    PostgreSQL 8 courtesy of Joey Adams.

  * postgresql-simple now sets standard_conforming_strings to "on".  This
    per-connection variable is initialized according to the server
    configuration,  which defaults to "off" for PostgreSQL < 9,  and "on"
    for PostgreSQL >= 9.   You may need to adjust any string literals in
    your SQL queries,  or set the variable yourself.

  * Exported (:.) from Database.PostgreSQL.Simple


Version 0.1.1: (2012-05-06)
  * Added some preliminary documentation for the Ok, Notification, and
    LargeObjects modules

  * Implemented the `fail` method for the monad instance for `Ok`.

  * Fixed a bug relating to handling the transaction level


Version 0.1:   (2012-05-04)
  * Renamed several modules, typeclasses, and functions:

        QueryParams  (renderParams)   -> ToRow   (toRow)
        QueryResults (convertResults) -> FromRow (fromRow)
        Param  (render)  -> ToField   (toField)
        Result (convert) -> FromField (fromField)

  * Added the `Database.PostgreSQL.Simple.Ok` module,  a variation of
    `Either SomeException` that has an instance for `Alternative` and also
    uses a list of exceptions to track the ways it has failed.

  * Changed the return type of `fromField` and `fromRow` from
    `Either SomeException` to `Ok`.

  * Thanks to suggestions from Ozgun Ataman, the `FromRow` typeclass has been
    massively improved.  The result is simpler definitions and better
    compositionality.  Also, user-defined instances need not be to be
    concerned about forcing the converted results to WHNF.  Here is an
    example comparing the old to the new:

        instance (Result a, Result b) => QueryResults (a,b) where
            convertResults [fa,fb] [va,vb] = do
                !a <- convert fa va
                !b <- convert fb vb
                return (a,b)
            convertResults fs vs  = convertError fs vs 2

        instance (FromField a, FromField b) => FromRow (a,b) where
            fromRow = (,) <$> field <*> field

  * Added `(:.)`, a pair that allows one to compose `FromRow` instances:

        instance (FromRow a, FromRow b) => FromRow (a :. b) where
            fromRow = (:.) <$> fromRow <*> fromRow

  * Moved the contents `Field` module into the `FromField` module.

  * Removed the `RawResult` type.

  * Added `DefaultIsolationLevel` as a distinct `IsolationLevel` option
    and   `DefaultReadWriteMode`  as a distinct `ReadWriteMode`.
